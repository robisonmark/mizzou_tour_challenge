# Missouri Tourism 2020 Regional Meetings
This repo has been designed as a challenge for my skills.
Varied skills are displayed through different branchs:

* master - Vuejs, with a static api pulling from JSON files, SCSS, eslint, and font-awesome
* feature/hardcoded - built with static content, gulpfile to compile SCSS, move images and run a mock server.
* feature/vue - Same as master
